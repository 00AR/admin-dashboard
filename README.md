# admin-dashboard

Admin Dashboard using MERN Stack. This project demonstrates my skills of using javascript and its libraries to produce a complete deployable website.
### Deployed website link: 
[https://admin-dashboard-xbw4.onrender.com](https://admin-dashboard-xbw4.onrender.com) 

**NOTE:** The website may take **some time to load on first visit!** It is deployed using free hosting service which automatically stops the web service when inactive for too long. Once up, the website will run smoothly thereafter :)
## Working:
This project uses mock data of sales and transactions of a store. This data is stored on a MongoDB cloud database. The frontend makes calls to this database through API endpoints 
and gets the data as response in json format. The reponse is interpretted and formatted to be displayed it to the user using relevant react components.

The exhaustive list of libraries and tools used:-
- Backend: Node JS, Express Js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
- Frontend: React, Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query. 

### Keypoints
There are certain keypoints that highlight some of the features and some of my learning from this project:

- Demonstration of the concept of Aggregate Calls in MongoDB which is similar to Joins in relational databases.
- Using Material UI components for UI.
- Creating an API using redux toolkit.
- Creating Charts with Nivo.
- Insights in some CSS features such as flex.
